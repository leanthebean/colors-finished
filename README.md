# ERC-721 Token Tutorial - Color Tokens (Finished)!

### Set Up
First, make sure you have nodejs v8, git, and metamask installed
- Node.js v8 (and npm) from https://nodejs.org/ (check your version by typing “node -v” in your terminal, if it’s below 7.6, please upgrade)
- Git from https://git-scm.com/
- Metamask from https://metamask.io/

Next up, start installing some global dependencies. We'll need testrpc and truffle for this tutorial
- `npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`
- `npm install -g truffle`

Next is to clone/download this repository and install all the node dependencies
1. `git clone git@github.com:leanthebean/colors.git`
2. `cd colors`
3. `npm install`

### Using Truffle + OpenZeppelin to write out our ERC-721 contract to mint Colors
We're going to inherit the implemented ERC-721 contract from OpenZeppelin
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Token.sol

As well as their Ownable implementation
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol

We already have access to these when we did `npm install` as OpenZeppelin was already a dependency in package.json

In the colors directory, type
4. `truffle init`

Notice that truffle now added 3 directories: `contracts`, `migrations`, and `test`

Open up your favorite IDE (I use VisualStudio with a Solidity plugin) and go into the contracts directory. Let's begin!

5. Create a new file called `ColorsERC721.sol` in the `contracts` directory
6. Create a new file called `ColorsERC721Test.js` in the `test` directory
7. Create a new file called `2_deploy_contracts.js` in the `migrations` directory

8. Follow the video/workshop steps to implement and test your contract, and once you do, the UI included in this tutorial should work with your contract :)

Happy hacking!
